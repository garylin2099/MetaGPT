##What?
The goal is to combine the code saved in the plan(plan.json) generated by DI with the corresponding score, and then allow the LLM to analyze relevant experiences from the code and save them locally.
##How to use?
Make the following modifications within the main() functionï¼š

* step1:Replace with the new score list
* step2:Replace with your path 
* step3:Replace with your folder path (the path where DI is automatically saved)

```javascript
{
async def main():
    score = [0.1241,0.1302,0.1313,0.1295,0.1292,0.1242,0.1375,0.1786,0.1567,0.1295,]  # Replace with the new score list
    path = "your_path"  # Replace with your path
    original_dir = (
        Path(path) / "metaGPT/MetaGPT/data/output_1"
    )  # Replace with your folder path (the path where DI is automatically saved)
}
```

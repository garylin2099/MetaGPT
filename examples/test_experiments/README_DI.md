## How to use?
1.step1: run kaggle_to_analysis.py

2.step2: run first_analysis_to_code.py

3.step3: run code_to_analysis.py

4.step4: run random_sample_analysis_with_baseline.py

5.step5: run insights_to_code.py

## The Result
1.After the first step, you will obtain manual experience extracted from Kaggle.

2.After the second step, you will utilize the experience from Kaggle to allow DI to generate the first round of 10 samples.

3.After the third step, you will obtain the experience from the first round of samples.

4.After the fourth step, you will obtain insights combined with the baseline code.

5.After the fifth step, you will obtain new code samples generated based on insights from different task types, which will be the samples for the second round.

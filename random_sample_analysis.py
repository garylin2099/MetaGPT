[Original Analysis]
Below are 20 randomly sampled experiences from a previous dataset, each labeled with an experience, a corresponding score, and a unique ID:
{analysis}

**Task**:
For each stage (Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Training):
- Reasoning: Analyze the provided experiences based on the variation in their scores to identify which experiences are most likely to improve model's performance. 
- Reference: Connect each key point with the corresponding experience ID.
- Insights: Based on the given reasons and referenced experience, provide some as specific and actionable as possible insights you believe can enhance the model's performance. Your insights must be listed in bullet points, with a minimum of 3 points(e.g.,1.). 

**Instructions for Output**:
Organize the output into three sections corresponding to each stage of data handling:
   - Data Preprocessing
   - Feature Engineering
   - Model Training

**Expected Output Format**:
```json
{{
    "Data Preprocessing": {{
        "Source": ["List all experience IDs related to data preprocessing."]
        "Reference IDs": ["List of IDs that you main reference or choose from this stage source."],
